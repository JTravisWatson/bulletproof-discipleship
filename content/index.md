# Welcome to my site
What is this place all about, anyway?

> [!bible]+
>  <sup> **2** </sup>Share the things that you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses with faithful men who will be able to teach others also.

> 2 Timothy 2:2 - MEV


I decided to start this site as an outlet for my written thoughts on various topics because I looked around the internet, and noticed a severe lack of people's thoughts and opinions being published. In reality, this is at the prompting of my wife. She sees a clear personal benefit from the overflow of my personal devotion, and finds it far more beneficial for her to read my thoughts on a matter rather than to ask me to ramble for an hour on a topic over and over.

Am I a professional minister? No, not really. Do I have a Theology Degree? No. Any college degree? Also, no. So why would anyone bother to listen to my thoughts? I'm not sure of the personal motivation of each ~~victim~~ reader, but I do have a little bit of a background with studying and teaching the Bible. My wife and I served as small group leaders at our church for several years, eventually stepping into the role of leading other small group leaders, and for a year we were sent as staff to head up small group ministry at a church plant in our small town.

What sort of topics will I write on? At the moment I plan on keeping the topics limited to general Biblical topics. I have no intention of turning this into a news or commentary platform. I'm perpetually Late To The Party <sup>TM</sup>, so nobody should count on me for current events. My real goal is to drive believers into a deeper love and obsession with the Word of God. I know that God's Word, and God Himself, has the power, authority, and ability to transform the believer in every aspect of their life; thoughts, relationships, outlook, reactions, obsessions, etc.

That didn't actually answer the question of what *will* be written about, more like what *won't* be written about. I'll try to write about things like worship, grace, missions,  salvation, and other broader topics that can be applied in the life of  believers.
