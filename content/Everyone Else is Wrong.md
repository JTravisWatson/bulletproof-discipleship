# Everyone else is wrong... about you.

  John 7:24 - MEV


- Don't read the title and think this is a political writeup, it's far nerdier than that: math and human behavior
## Extrapolation and you

- Extrapolation
	- Examples:
		- 1,2,3,... 4,5,6
		- 2,4... 6,8,10?
		- 10,20... 30,40?
	- or could it be
		- 1,2,3... 5,8,13
		- 2,4... 8, 16, 32
		- 10, 20... 40, 80, 160 
- If given more data, extrapolation becomes more accurate, or in reality, we have a higher likeliness of being correct
	- 1,2,3,4,5...6,7,8,9,10
## Humans, not numbers
- Human behavior is the same way
- We extrapolate what people will do, or react all the time
- The more time we spend with a person, the higher our chance of being correct
- If I think about the person I know the best, my wife, it illustrates this perfectly
- She often surprises me with the things she says and does
	- yes, life together is still fun and exciting after 12 years of marriage
- The reverse is also true, she knows the most about me
- We are still extrapolating what we know about each other, and we often come up incorrect
- Nobody knows us better than Christ
