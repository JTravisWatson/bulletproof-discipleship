# Introduction

I am from Texas.
I have a wife and 5 children.
In University I studied Music, but I never finished my degree.
I lived in Texas, and was always involved at my church.
We led many Home Groups, and eventually we asked to lead Home Group Leaders.
After a while, we were asked to be part of planting a new church in our small town.
During that time, God clearly asked us to move to Moscow and learn Russian.
When the war started, we had to quickly move.
We ended up in Bishkek.
We thought it would only be 3-5 months, but it became 18 months.
God led us here to Karakol where I now live and work.

If the Bible originates in the infallible mind of God, it must be consistent throughout. Because there can be no contradiction in the mind of God, there can be no contradiction in the revelation of God. What the Bible teaches in one place it cannot refute in another. Therefore, any true doctrine must be consistent with the whole of Scripture.

### Test 1
The test: Does this doctrine originate with God or has it been fabricated by someone or something else?
### Test 2
The test: Does this doctrine appeal to the Bible for its authority? Or does it appeal to another scripture or another mind?
### Test 3
The test: Is this doctrine established or refuted by the entirety of Scripture?
### Test 4
Does this lead to spiritual growth, or ignorance?
### Test 5
Does this teaching encourage godly living, or sin?

Sound doctrine originates with God, is recorded in the Word of God, is consistent with the whole revelation of God, and leads to both spiritual health and godly living. False doctrine originates with men or demons, is foreign to the Word of God, is inconsistent with the whole revelation of God, and leads to spiritual weakness and ungodly living.

## Phrases to test
